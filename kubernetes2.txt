1. How do you handle Kubernetes cluster security?

To secure a Kubernetes cluster, I follow these key practices:
Network Policies
By default, all pods can talk to each other.
I enable Network Policies to restrict communication and only allow required traffic between pods and namespaces.
RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
I apply the least-privilege principle.
Users, service accounts, and applications get only the permissions they need — no one gets cluster-admin unless required.
Namespaces for Isolation
I use namespaces to separate environments and applications — for example, dev, UAT, prod.
This helps in multi-tenancy, resource control, and security isolation.
Admission Controllers / Pod Security Standards
I enforce Pod Security Policies/Standards like restricted mode.
This blocks privileged containers, root users, and enforces secure defaults during deployment.
Audit Logging
I enable audit logs to monitor cluster activity and detect suspicious actions.
Logs are forwarded to a central monitoring tool for alerts and investigation.
